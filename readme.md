# Seizure Tracker  


This is a Plotly dash app which can be used to record, view, and predict seizures.

The app is currently hosted in an Amazon Web Services Elastic Beanstalk environment and is refreshed using a lambda function, although it is currently in the process of being deployed on a raspberry pi.
